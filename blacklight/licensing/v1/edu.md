# Blacklight Licensing - Educational License

## What's What

This is a Legal Agreement ("License") between Blacklight Productions and Blacklight Licensing ("we") and you,
the Licensee ("you"), for the licensing of any works that link to this license ("content").

## License Conditions

**You may use any content that links to this license in an educational, non-commercial way,** providing you:

- Link to the original content
- Give credit to the original content's creator (typically Blacklight Productions, but make sure of this)
- Link to this license

**We expect you to create a derivative work of the content, and not simply re-upload it.** Re-uploading without
modification is therefore disallowed under this license, meaning you must add a substantial amount of "extra work"
on top of the content to remain within this license.

```
IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS IS NOT A COMMERCIAL LICENSE.

THIS LICENSE CAN ONLY BE USED, AND MUST ONLY BE USED, IN A PURELY EDUCATIONAL FASHION. THIS DOES NOT
INCLUDE USING THIS CONTENT IN AN EDUCATIONAL MANNER WITH INTENT TO MONETISE THE CONTENT OR DERIVATIVE
WORK, except where permitted by Fair Use or other applicable law. If you're not sure whether your use 
case comes under this license or not, CONTACT US first.

ALSO IMPORTANT: THIS IS NOT A (fully) NON-COMMERCIAL LICENSE.

This bit may make the least sense, but bear with us. **We are not licensing this content to you to use
non-commercially, no matter what. IT IS ONLY LICENSED FOR NON-COMMERCIAL, PURELY EDUCATIONAL USAGE.** 
For example, acceptable use is using one of our videos to demonstrate an editing technique in an
educational institution. Unacceptable use is reacting to said editing technique, then adding no educational
benefit.

Note: You CAN use the content on an educational YouTube video, PROVIDING you do not monetise the content. This
doesn't stop you monetising the rest of your channel/account.
